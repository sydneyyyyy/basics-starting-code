 # Variables & Constants

Variables are a data container/data storage.
Created by using the "let" keyword, name, = , and the value. 

> let userName = "max";

Constants are also a data container but it is created with the "const" keyword. The value cannot be changed. 

> const totalUsers = 15;

use constants as often as possible (whenever you actually get data that never changes) to be clear about your intentions in your code. 

JS is CASE-SENSITIVE

In JS you do NOT have to initialize a variable with a value.
