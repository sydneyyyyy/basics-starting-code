 # Variables & Constants

Variables are a data container/data storage.
Created by using the "let" keyword, name, = , and the value. 

> let userName = "max";

Constants are also a data container but it is created with the "const" keyword. The value cannot be changed. 

> const totalUsers = 15;

use constants as often as possible (whenever you actually get data that never changes) to be clear about your intentions in your code. 

JS is CASE-SENSITIVE

In JS you do NOT have to initialize a variable with a value. 

## Operators

Mathematical characters that allow us to manipulate values ( +, -, *, /, % = remainder, ** = exponentation, '=')

## Data Types

- Numbers => 2, -3, 22.956
- String (text) => "Hi", 'Hello World!', `Hello` 


HTML code is executed from top to bottom. If the script tag is placed in the middle of the page, the JS code is then parsed, compiled, and then executed top to bottom. 

### Template Literal

``${expression} or ${variable}``

Allows you to include dynamic values within a string. `` also allows you to use multi-line quotes.
